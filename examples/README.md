## üîê HardID

**HardID** is a powerful CLI tool for generating unique hardware-based IDs using **SHA-256 hashing**.  
It leverages data from the HardView library to create IDs from specific components or the entire system.

### Usage Examples:
```bash
python hwid_cli.py --type cpu        # Generate ID from CPU info
python hwid_cli.py --combined        # Generate a unified ID from all components
python hwid_cli.py --all --dis       # Generate all IDs without showing the logo
