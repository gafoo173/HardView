* **New `_objects` functions:**

  * For each JSON-returning function, a corresponding `_objects` version has been added (e.g., `get_bios_info_objects()`).
* **GPU Information Support:**

  * New functions introduced:

    * `get_gpu_info()`: GPU info as JSON
    * `get_gpu_info_objects()`: GPU info as Python objects

## \[2.0.3] - Hotfix Release

### Highlights:

* **Fixed an issue in get_smart_info():**

  *Fixed an issue in the get_smart_info() function:

* **No functional/API changes.**
